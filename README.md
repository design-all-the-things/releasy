[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/design-all-the-things/releasy.png)](https://travis-ci.org/design-all-the-things/releasy)

Web app to follow release workflow, from feature declaration to production

## Design

As we explain in [our journey through this initiative](our-experiments.md), we made a couple of workshops to design _**Releasy**_. [Here](design/index.md), you can take a look at what we produced so far.

- You will find the [Big Picture Event Storming result, and the story around it, here](design/event-storming/big-picture.md).
- Our Story Mapping session has been captured in [this opened Trello board](https://trello.com/b/ZotT81x6/story-map).

## Join us

If you want to join the initiative and know more about releasy, please read [the dedicated page](join-us.md)

You can also have a look to [a quick feedback of the initiative](our-experiments.md), from day 0 until now.

## Build

We need the `.NET Core` at least version `3.0`.
You can use the Makefile to build the project and run the tests using `make build` and `make tests`.
The `make help` will give you all the available commands.
